# Radar-Simulations
This repository contains MATLAB scripts to simulate several operations of an FMCW radar. 
The aim of this repository is to provide a starting point to the researchers and save their time.
I hope it will gain many collaborators and help multiple researchers working on radar signal processing.

Cheers!
